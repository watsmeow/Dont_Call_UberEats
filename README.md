## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a work in progress recipe getter app. This app pulls from a recipe API to provide the user with recipes based on user selected criteria.

## Lessons Learned:

Although the nested API calls work relatively well for what they are, the following things certainly need to be re-worked: 
- more input validation
- suggestions for alternate calls if user input does not meet API criteria or exist in the DB
- could certainly be made to be object oriented
- use JS to create and remove elements rather than relying on styling and function that hide and display elements
